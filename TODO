Build out GET endpoint to query database
      ?? update list invalid emails to also give email_status (theoretically if
      can get bounce/failure/etc status from ses)

Database update -- keep track of when verification email is sent to not overspam --
maybe re-send every two weeks

Update sending verification where if hash/password already in database use
the exisiting so any email sent is clickable.
