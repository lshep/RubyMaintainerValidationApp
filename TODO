Build out GET endpoint to query database
      ?? update list invalid emails to also give email_status (theoretically if
      can get bounce/failure/etc status from ses)

Update core.db to integrate with ses to retrieve bounced/failed emails and
update email_status 

?? Update sending verification where if hash/password already in database use
the exisiting so any email sent is clickable.
